🚀 Time Series Forecasting with XGBoost: Predicting Energy Production ⚡

I recently worked on a time series forecasting project to predict annual energy production using machine learning techniques. One of the standout tools in this process was the XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm, a powerful and efficient implementation of the gradient boosting framework.

🔍 What is XGBoost? XGBoost is renowned for its speed and performance. It handles large datasets well and is widely used in both classification and regression problems. In this project, I applied XGBoost to forecast energy production in megawatts (MW) using historical data.

💡 Key Features of My Approach:

    Pre-processed data to include features like hour, day of the week, month, and year.
    Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
    Leveraged XGBoost to train the model, fine-tuning it with early stopping and learning rate adjustments.
    Visualized and analyzed the feature importance to understand which factors had the most influence on predictions.
    Evaluated the model using root mean squared error (RMSE) for accuracy.

📊 Results:

    The model successfully predicted energy production trends, with the predictions closely aligning with actual values, as seen in the plots.
    XGBoost’s ability to manage both temporal patterns and non-linear relationships contributed to accurate and reliable results.
